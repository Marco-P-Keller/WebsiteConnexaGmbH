    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 09.01.2025</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the website of Connexa GmbH (hereinafter referred to as 
      “we,” “us,” or “our”). We are committed to respecting your privacy 
      and believe in maintaining transparent practices. This Privacy Policy 
      explains how we handle personal information on our website, including 
      how we process, store, and protect any data that you provide or that 
      may be automatically collected during your visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using our website, you agree to the practices outlined in this 
      Privacy Policy. Please read it carefully to understand how we collect 
      and use your information, and how you can manage your preferences.
    </p>

    <h2>2. No Collection of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
      We do not actively collect or store personal data from our website 
      visitors. Specifically:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>No cookies or similar tracking technologies:</strong>  
        We have disabled all cookie-tracking features, meaning that no 
        cookies are placed on your device when you visit our website. 
        This includes both first-party and third-party cookies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No analytics or tracking scripts:</strong>  
        We do not run any analytics services (such as Google Analytics) 
        or tracking scripts that monitor user activity, page visits, or 
        browsing behavior.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No personal information requests:</strong>  
        We do not request or store any personal information (e.g., names, 
        email addresses, or phone numbers) from our visitors for marketing 
        or promotional purposes. Consequently, we do not maintain any form 
        of user database for our website.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Our priority is to ensure that your privacy remains safeguarded and 
      that you can browse our website anonymously without intrusive data 
      collection or personalized advertising.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Hosting and Log Files</h2>
    <p>
      Although we do not collect personal data, our hosting provider may 
      automatically log certain technical details when you visit our site. 
      These server log files can include information such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>IP address</li>
      <li>Date and time of access</li>
      <li>Browser type and version</li>
      <li>Operating system</li>
      <li>Referring URL (the previous page you visited)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These logs are typically maintained by the hosting provider for 
      diagnostic, security, and statistical purposes. However, we do not 
      use this data to identify or track individuals. We only access these 
      logs to ensure site functionality, detect potential security threats, 
      and maintain the website.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Our website does not embed any third-party services (e.g., social 
      media plugins, video embeds, or analytics) that automatically collect 
      personal information. Should we integrate any new third-party service 
      in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy and clearly 
      disclose how these services might collect and process your data.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of our commitment to privacy, we regularly review potential 
      third-party integrations to ensure they align with our privacy 
      standards and values.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      While we do not collect personal information, we take reasonable 
      precautions to protect our website’s infrastructure and any server 
      logs maintained by our hosting provider. These measures aim to 
      mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, or other 
      forms of security threats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our security practices may include the use of encryption protocols, 
      secure network configurations, regular updates and patches, and 
      internal access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can 
      manage our website content.
    </p>

    <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Our website is hosted in Switzerland, and any server logs or 
      operational data are processed in accordance with Swiss data 
      protection laws. We do not intentionally transfer any user data 
      outside of Switzerland. In the event that any form of data transfer 
      becomes necessary in the future, we will ensure that the data is 
      adequately protected under the relevant legal frameworks and data 
      protection regulations.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>
      Since we do not collect personal data, there is no personal 
      information to update, request deletion for, or opt out of. If, 
      however, you believe that our practices might involve your personal 
      information in some way, you may contact us to address any questions 
      or concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
      We respect the privacy rights of all our visitors and remain 
      committed to providing transparency regarding our data handling 
      processes.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our website is not directed toward children, and we do not knowingly 
      collect personal information from children under the age of 16. 
      Since we do not gather any personal data at all, this measure 
      reinforces our dedication to protecting the privacy of vulnerable 
      users.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any 
      time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal and regulatory 
      reasons. The updated version will be posted on our website, and the 
      “Last updated” date at the top will be revised accordingly. We 
      encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay 
      informed about how we are protecting your data.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
